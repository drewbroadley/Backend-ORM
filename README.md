## DESCRIPTION

The PHP library is an ORM based class for PHP and MySQL. The difference between this library and others, is this library automatically builds the schema (models) for you and updates it regularly (cache for a few minutes)

What to expect:

* Retreiving data is much faster
* Inserting and updating data is much much faster
* Handles the everyday MySQL querying
* Creates explicit SQL that stops laziness like SELECT * FROM...

It doesn't do everything, this was built to remove the everyday SQL man-handling that gets done everyday. I would imagine it would cover 90-95% of your current queries

## BASIC USAGE

Coming soon, see example.php
